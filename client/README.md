# React Chat Project
This is a React chat project written in JavaScript that allows you to communicate with other users in real-time(on the localhost). 

To get started, you will need to clone the repository from GitHub and follow a few steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Installation
To install the necessary dependencies for this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Here are the steps to install the required packages:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khaledfs/AP2_1b
```
2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd AP2_1b
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
npm i scripts
```
This command will read the package.json file and download all the necessary packages and dependencies required to run the project.

# Running the Project
Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can start the project on your local machine. Use the following command to run the project:
```bash
npm start
```
This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. You can access the chat application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Once you have completed the installation, you're ready to start using the React Chat app. Here's a step-by-step guide:
# Usage
1. Launch the app, and you will see the login window displayed on the screen.
2. To log in, you need to be a registered user. If you're not registered yet, click on the "Register" button to access the registration window.
3. In the registration window, enter your name and a password. The password must follow a specific format, containing at least one uppercase letter (A-Z), one lowercase letter (a-z), and one digit (0-9). The password should be at least 8 characters long.
4. After setting up your password, you'll need to enter a display name and upload a profile picture.
5. Once you've completed the registration process, you're ready to connect! Return to the login window and log in using your registered credentials.
6. After logging in, you will see the chat window screen. Here, you can add users and contacts and start sending messages to them.
7. Currently, the chat app only supports sending messages. In the next stage of the project's development, we plan to introduce additional chat app features and methods.

Now you can interact with the React chat application and start messaging with other users in real-time.
